# Live API - Web Console

This repository contains a react-based starter app for using the [Live API](<[https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api](https://ai.google.dev/api/multimodal-live)>) over a websocket. It provides modules for streaming audio playback, recording user media such as from a microphone, webcam or screen capture as well as a unified log view to aid in development of your application.

Watch the demo of the Live API [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_q7JY1XxFE).

## Usage

To get started, [create a free Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and add it to the `.env` file. Then:

```
$ npm install && npm start
```

We have provided several example applications on other branches of this repository:

- [demos/GenExplainer](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console/tree/demos/genexplainer)
- [demos/GenWeather](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console/tree/demos/genweather)
- [demos/GenList](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console/tree/demos/genlist)

## Example

The **Instructions** sidebar lets you edit the system prompt at any time. You can also set an initial prompt programmatically:

```typescript
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useLiveAPIContext } from "./contexts/LiveAPIContext";

export function useInitialPrompt() {
  const { setConfig } = useLiveAPIContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    setConfig({
      model: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
      systemInstruction:
        "You are a personal AI coach. The coach will be the impersonation of target audience such as for recruiters it will impersonate as a candidate, for sales team it will impersonate as a customer.",
    });
  }, [setConfig]);
}
```

## development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Project consists of:

- an Event-emitting websocket-client to ease communication between the websocket and the front-end
- communication layer for processing audio in and out
- a boilerplate view for starting to build your apps and view logs

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
